# PRODIGY_ML_01 
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression
Overview
This project implements a Linear Regression model to predict house prices based on:

Square footage
Number of bedrooms
Number of bathrooms
Objective
To build a model that helps understand the relationship between house features and prices.

Files in the Repository
train.csv: Training dataset with house features and prices.
test.csv: Testing dataset for model evaluation.
sample_submission.csv: Sample output format for house price predictions.
data_description.txt: Details of the dataset.
Task 1 linear regression model...: Model implementation script.
Usage
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Prasanth535/PRODIGY_ML_01.git
Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the model training script to predict house prices.

Evaluation
The model is evaluated using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and R-squared (RÂ²).
